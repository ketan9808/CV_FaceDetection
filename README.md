# CV_FaceDetectionn

## overview
face detection is widely used nowadays. so this program illustrade a basic techinque to detect faces.
this face use haarcascade classifier for face detection and opencv library for image pre-processing and post-processing.


## HaarCascade vs HOG vs CNN
the haarcascade classifier is average in case of speed and accuracy as compared to HOG(Histogram of oriented gradient) and CNN(Convolution Neural Network).the HOG is fastest in terms of speed but is less accurate and CNN is more accurate out of 3 but take more time to detect faces.

all of these are implemented in the respective files.

## HaarCascade Classifier
HaarCascade is machine learning model to detect various object. The models are trained using both possitive image(images with faces) and negative image(images without faces). It provide various classifiers for detecting various objects like:
- faces
- eyes
- left eye
- right eye
- eyes with glasses
- full body 
- upper body
- lower body
- smiles
- licence plate

## face detection and music player
This program uses cascade classifier to detect faces and play music whenever any face is detected in frame and when the face goes out of frame the music stops.
